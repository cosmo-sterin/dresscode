This repository contains code that performs a **catalogue matching** task on a custom apparel dataset with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) techniques.
Please consider looking at the [report](https://github.com/tcosmo/dresscode/blob/master/report.pdf) for a full description of this work.
## Catalogue Matching
Given the catalogue of a retailer as a dataset of photos, the task is to indentificate which of these objects people are wearing in 
real life photos that we call **queries**.
## The Dataset
The chosen dataset simplfies the task. It consists in all the dresses of the H&M french online catalogue.    
The **real world** photos consists in the models that wear the items. You get associations like these:
### Catalogue Item
![alt text](old/ex_cat.jpg "An item of the catalogue")
### Corresponding Model (Query)
![alt text](old/ex_mod.jpg "A model wearing it")
### Getting the dataset
To get get the dataset you should execute *get_dataset.py* with python3.   
It will download the catalogue items in **db/robes/cat/** and the corresponding models in **db/robes/mod/**.   
At the time the experiment was made it consisted in 210 items, the photos are of good quality the whole takes about **200Mo**.    
**Important:** if you want to re-conduct the following results you should check that the file **to_ignore.txt** is still 
adequate to the DB. This variable stores ill-formed examples (where no models wear the item or ill formated jpg files).
